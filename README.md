This is the beginner tutorial on how to use github

Hi, I'm Matthew and this is my second, and most serious venture into github. I'm in my senior year of Information Technology at the Univeristy of North Florida because I want to get into cyber security because it interests me. I'm at a crossroads though, after playing a few great video games I've rediscovered why I wanted to get into programming in the first place: story telling through video games as a medium. Making a decision on what I want to work with for the rest of my life is really daunting but I'm sure I'll make it through this.
